To start this project, please run the following command from the directory: node server.js
This will launch the server and connect to the database, assuming you have created it correctly. We have included a SQL script you can use to create the database for your local directory.

Then, navigate to localhost:8080. This will launch the page. Then, you can navigate through the buttons to add categories to the game. 
Please add in three players at the bottom of the screen and hit Generate Clues and Answers. This will launch a new page for the host (Alex Trebek) to use for the game.
Then, click start game. This will initialize the MySQL Database and start the game screen in a new window. 
When you click on a game tile, a modal will pop up with the question. Pause the timer below if someone answered the question and make the appropriate point selection based on the answer if it was valid or invalid. This will update the MySQL Database as well as the UI.
